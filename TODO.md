Todo list:
don't start app with placeholder colors, not on the canvas nor history, if there's no history just say that.
There isn't a way to edit the colors, button does not work.
implement undo and redo functionality
color history can be a singular row i can step left or right, having the most recent one to the left and going right to oldest so it doesn't clutter screen.
